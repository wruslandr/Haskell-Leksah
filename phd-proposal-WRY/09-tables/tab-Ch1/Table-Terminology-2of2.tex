			\hline 11 & CNC Motion Controller & The S/W component that implements and controls, for example, CNC tool motions, like direction, velocity, position, torque, acceleration, deceleration, feedrate and so on. This is to achieve tool accuracy in following path trajectory, tool motion smoothness, and avoid tool jerks.\\
			
			\hline 12 & CNC Error Controller & The S/W component that implements and controls, for example, CNC tool trajectory or path tracking, path error computation, path monitoring and compensation, lookahead control, adaptive control, iterative control, predictive control, AI control, and so on.\\
			
			\hline 13 & CNC Services Controller & The S/W component that controls CNC service functions like to start and stop the tool, to start and stop lubrication fluids, to pause and change tool cutters, and so on. It also monitors and controls other auxiliary services like excessive vibrations, over-currents, over speeds, broken tools, over heating and so on. \\
			
			\hline 14 & CNC HMI Controller & The Human-Machine Interface (HMI) S/W component that handles inputs/outputs with humans to control the CNC machine. This component also provides display and monitoring services for the entire operation of the CNC machine.\\
			
			\hline 15 & CNC Control Loop & The S/W component that coordinates and controls the timely executions of the following software sub-components:
			
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item CNC G-Code Interpreter
				\item CNC G-Code Interpolator
				\item CNC Signal Driver
				\item CNC Motion Controller
				\item CNC Error Controller
				\item CNC Services Controller
			\end{enumerate} 
			When the CNC Control Loop execution completes and exits, the CNC machine operations is considered completed or execution finished. \\
			
			\hline 15 & CNC Controller software (CCS) & The complete S/W application that combines the CNC Human-Machine Interface (HMI) Controller with the CNC Control Loop and its associated sub-components. \\
