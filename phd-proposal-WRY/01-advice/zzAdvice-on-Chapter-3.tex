\textbf{Chapter 3 Guidelines - TO REMOVE LATER}	
\vspace*{1\baselineskip}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Coverage} - The chapter Research Objectives and Approach clarifies the 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item research objectives of the project
			\item background description of the state of the art (current)
			\item methodological approaches in mind to tackle key research challenges
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item \textbf{Clarifications} - The research objectives should
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Build solidly on the State of the Art (current state) 
			\item Relate the research to the work carried out by others 
			\item Elucidate the measure to which the work develops from their work 
			\item Elucidate and the extent to which it diverges from theirs 
			\item Open up new and yet unexplored ideas and avenues 
			
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item \textbf{Descriptions} - In essence, the chapter research objectives and approach explains
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item what you plan to do to tackle the research problem, 
			\item why you plan to do it that way, 
			\item and how you are going to do it.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item \textbf{How-to} - Research methodology components 
		
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The how-to component of the proposal is called the Research Methods, or Methodology. 
			
			\item It should be detailed enough to let the reader decide whether the methods you intend to use are adequate for the research at hand. 
			
			\item It should go beyond the mere listing of research tasks, by asserting why you assume that the methods or methodologies you have chosen represent the best available approaches for your project.
			
			\item This means that you should include a discussion of possible alternatives and credible explanations of why your approach is the most valid.
