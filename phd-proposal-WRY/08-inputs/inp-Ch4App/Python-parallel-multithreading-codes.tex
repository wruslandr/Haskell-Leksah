NOTES ABOUT THIS PYTHON CODE: 
This program is about multi-threading implemented using the python programming language. Multi-threaded programs "share everything" in its environment. This is how simple and short the code looks like. For more information go to : http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW/threading/
